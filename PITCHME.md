Repeatr
=======

---

Repeatr is not a package manager.

Repeatr is not a build tool.

---

Repeatr is a "computation addressable" system.

Computation definition|representation

Something like that.  We need to make up words for it because this is not a common concept!

---

You can use it to produce better build tools and package management.

---

Think of Repeatr like a lab notebook...

... but you write the procedures first, and then
an army of robots carries it out for you.

In a clean, sealed room.

And reports the results.
